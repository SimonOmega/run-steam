Introduction
------------
The run-steam.sh script will execute Steam Client with a few settings that help the client display properly.
The run-L4D2-Beta.sh script will execute L4D2 Beta with settings that help it run under Debian based Systems.

Both Scripts Detect Optirun and use it if available.

Yes Ubuntu is base off Debian, but Ubuntu also does a few things their own way.
That is why some of these settings are needed to support true Debian Based Systems.

This script is compiled from many sources of information, and many personal hours of debuging.
